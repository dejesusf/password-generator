# Password Generator

## Description
For this assignment, we were given the task of completing starter code for a password generator. A successful generator will present the user with a series of prompts or criteria in order to formulate the password. This would include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters. At the end, the generator will spit out a randomized password that fits the user's choices. It would have been displayed with an alert or written directly to the page. 

In the initial submission of this assignment, I failed to grasp an understanding of how "if else" statements worked. With a lot of self studying and progession in this bootcamp, I was able to revisit this assignment and rewrite the code I had to make this generator work.
