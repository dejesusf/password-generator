# Password Generator

## Description
For this assignment, we were given the task of completing starter code for a password generator. A successful generator will present the user with a series of prompts or criteria in order to formulate the password. This would include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters. At the end, the generator will spit out a randomized password that fits the user's choices. It would have been displayed with an alert or written directly to the page. 

JavaScript provides the page with interactivity and makes webpages more dimensional.
